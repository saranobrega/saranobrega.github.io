Hi there! :smiley:

Thanks for visiting my website.

Here I write about my favourite machine learning/data science projects that I have been working on, either through internships, work, online challenges, or topics that I like to research out of curiosity. :eyes:

I currently work as an R&D Engineer with a focus on data science. My work involves contributing to European-funded projects dedicated to accelerating the data economy and aligning with the goals of the European Green Deal.  :earth_africa:

More recently, I have been focusing on synthetic data generation, time-series forecasting, MLOps and I am beginning the exciting journey of learning and developing LLM applications for the company I work for. :bulb:
