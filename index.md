Hi there! :smiley:

Thanks for visiting my website.

Here I write about my favourite machine learning/data science projects that I have been working on, either through internships, work, online challenges, or topics that I like to research out of curiosity. :eyes:

I currently work as sn R&D Engineer with a focus on data science. I work on European-funded projects to accelarate the data economy that also aim to achieve the goals of the European Green Deal. :earth_africa:

More recently, I have been focusing on synthetic data generation, time-series forecasting, MLOps and I am beginning to learn and develop LLM applications for the company I work for. :bulb:
