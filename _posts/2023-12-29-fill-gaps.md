## Efficient Gap Filling in Wind Turbine Data Using LightGBM

In the era of renewable energy buzz, wind turbine data should be as predictable as a grandma's cookie recipe. 
But guess what? Itâ€™s not always like this. Time-series data plays hide-and-seek, and gaps are there to  crash the party.

This is where LightGBM comes into hand for efficient gap filling in time-series data.

This solution aims to enhance data completeness, ensuring a more accurate and robust analysis by addressing missing values in a systematic manner. 

LightGBM's efficiency in handling large datasets make it the ideal choice for this task, allowing for a seamless integration of machine learning into the gap-filling process.

Built upon the foundation of XGBoost, LightGBM stands as a formidable player in the realm of gradient boosting models. Sharing common roots, these models exhibit similarities in their approach to boosting decision trees.

Both XGBoost and LightGBM strive for excellence in terms of scalability, efficiency, and predictive performance!
### Background
Time-series data is basically a chronological sequence of observations. It holds the heartbeat of dynamic processes, making it a foundation in various domains.

Its importance lies in capturing trends, patterns, and dependencies over time, offering a lens into evolving phenomena. However, analyzing time-series data comes with its set of challenges. The temporal dimension introduces complexities such as seasonality, trend variations, and the omnipresent issue of missing values.

### The Problem

Time-series wind turbine data also presents some challenges.  Wind turbine data often exhibits seasonal patterns, influenced by weather conditions and environmental factors.

If we look closely, by decreasing the size of the dataset, we can better inspect the seasonality of the data:

Seasonal changes can lead to variations in wind patterns, affecting the performance of wind turbines. During certain seasons, the wind may be less consistent or more turbulent, resulting in gaps or missing values in the recorded data. These gaps can occur due to factors such as low wind speeds, maintenance activities, or sensor malfunctions during specific seasonal conditions.

Seasonal adjustments or operational changes made by turbine operators to optimize performance may introduce discontinuities in the data. For example, if operational adjustments are made during a particular season, there may be periods of missing data or data with different characteristics.

Gaps or missing values in the time-series data are common due to sensor malfunctions, maintenance, or other operational issues. Filling in these gaps accurately without introducing bias is a critical challenge for reliable analysis!

### The Solution 

Engineered for speed and scalability, LightGBM boasts a unique approach to tree-building that makes it particularly well-suited for time-series data. 

Having previously employed LightGBM for forecasting with exceptional outcomes, it became the natural choice when faced with the challenge of addressing data gaps. 

Its ability to handle large datasets and efficiently navigate the temporal intricacies of time-series information positions LightGBM as a powerful tool for tasks like gap filling in wind turbine data.

My approach involved addressing gaps in the data during as a forecasting task. For instance, when encountering a 2-hour gap in the dataset, I trained the model using the preceding data points and tasked it with predicting the missing data points within that gap. In essence, we are treating the problem as a multi-step forecasting task.

Additionally, since only one variable (WindSpeed) is employed in this approach, it is referred to as recursive multi-step forecasting.

However, the challenge lay in communicating to LightGBM the presence of specific gaps and enabling it to comprehend the number of missing data points. 

The missing data manifested in the form of absent rows. 

To address this, I implemented the following strategy: first, I detected gaps in the DATE column. Subsequently, I calculated the size of each gap, which in turn determined the forecast horizon (i.e., the number of data points to predict). Additionally, I computed the starting index of each gap, providing the model with the necessary information to initiate predictions from that particular data point. 

Of course, a lot of **data exploration** and pre-processing was performed. Getting intimate with the data is one the most important steps in any data science/machine learning project. Some pre-processing steps in this project included: outlier removal, understanding the statistical distribution of data, data validation and feature engineering (creating lag features).

This strategy proved to be highly effective in practice!


### Results and Validation 

Several procedures were adopted to make sure the best model would be created:
 - Hyperparameter Tuning of LightGBM
 - Cross-validation 
 - Lag Feature Tuning
 - Tweaking the train size 

It would be too much information to display here. So here I showcase some results regarding the lag feature tuning:
<br><br>

|          | MAE   | MSE   | MAPE  |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Lag 2    | 0.685 | 0.653 | 4.116 |
| Lag 3    | 0.614 | 0.589 | 3.623 |
| Lag 4    | 0.792 | 0.880 | 4.808 |

### Pros and Cons

**Advantages:** All the advantages listed above regarding lightgbm (scalability, adaptability, robustness, simple hyperparameter tuning) ;). Plus, as we are tranining no neural network, the runtime is relatively very fast, as you can imagine. Besides, it is highly explainable :) . 

Given my strong interest in explainable AI, coupled with the development of a service for a client, a model like this proves highly valuable. Its transparency and interpretability in decision-making enable thorough result explanations, and it facilitates an examination of which features contribute most significantly to the outcomes.


**Limitations:** There is a distinct limitation to consider. In cases where the gap appears at the beginning of the dataset, for instance, before the 500th sample, the model's performance may be compromised. This is attributed to the fact that the model is trained using the entire dataset preceding the gap's index. Therefore, if a gap initiates at, let's say, index 300, the model is only trained with 299 data samples, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. Intriguingly, beyond the 500th index, the model consistently produces highly satisfactory results.

In my specific use case, this wasn't a significant concern, as I anticipated receiving datasets from the client with over 1000k+ rows. This substantial amount of data mitigated the impact of gaps occurring at the beginning of the dataset, allowing the model to be trained on a sufficiently large sample size and yielding satisfactory results.

The plot below illustrates the limitation I just mentioned. As observed, certain predictions on the date 2019-12-13 do not align with the temporal distribution of the surrounding data points. Notably, the model forecasts identical values across a span of 10+ data points. I am aware, based on the specifications of my use case, that such a pattern would not be representative of real-world data.
