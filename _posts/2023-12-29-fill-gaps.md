## Efficient Gap Filling in Wind Turbine Data Using LightGBM

In the era of renewable energy buzz, wind turbine data should be as predictable as a grandma's cookie recipe. 
But guess what? Itâ€™s not always like this. Time-series data plays hide-and-seek, and gaps are there to  crash the party.

This is where LightGBM comes into hand for efficient gap filling in time-series data.

This solution aims to enhance data completeness, ensuring a more accurate and robust analysis by addressing missing values in a systematic manner. 

LightGBM's efficiency in handling large datasets make it the ideal choice for this task, allowing for a seamless integration of machine learning into the gap-filling process.

Built upon the foundation of XGBoost, LightGBM stands as a formidable player in the realm of gradient boosting models. Sharing common roots, these models exhibit similarities in their approach to boosting decision trees.

Both XGBoost and LightGBM strive for excellence in terms of scalability, efficiency, and predictive performance!
